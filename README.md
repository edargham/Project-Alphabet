	Why Homebrew/Linuxbrew?
	You may be asking why you should use a third-party package manager. Here are some advantages:
	
	Can install software to a home directory and so does not require sudo.
	Install software not packaged by the native distribution.
	Install up-to-date versions of software when the native distribution is old.
	Use the same package manager to manage both your Mac and Linux machines.

	and Linux before coming here.  
	
	brew install node  

2 - node package manager (npm):  
	Windows: Make sure to select it while installing node.js from the link above  
	Mac and Linux: 	Newer versions of node install npm automatically.  
	However, you can also open Terminal and Type:

## **WARNING:** Dependacy Issues:
The `react-multi-toggle` package installed by yarn is a broken package. Fortunately, there is a workaround for it.
you are kindly requested to clone the package from GitHub:  
  
https://github.com/danielarias123/react-multi-toggle  
  
And replace the `index.js` and the `index-es6.js` from the cloned repo to the package found in `node_modules` in the project directory.
